Met with Professor Hornof about specifications:
    *Want to use data to incentivise total class participation
    *Keep track of overall participation of each student
    *Diversity and inclusion
        -> Perhaps prioritize low-participation students for On-Deck position
    *PRIORITY = get people to talk
    *Flag + log students
        -> flash of green for students who participate well, but no bad flashes
    *Develop for Mac OS
